# Solution - TUNE Coding Challenge

demo.PNG provides a glimplse of how the app looks.

## Intallation Steps

Checkout the code repository under a php working directory. For example, for WAMP place it under "www" directory. For XAMPP, under "htdocs" directory. And for linux it can be "/var/www/html" directory (depending upon nix flavor and nginx/apache configuration).

### PHP App

PHP and HTTP services are required to run this server.

Start the php service so that the following url is accessible from the browser:

<pre>http://localhost:&lt;php port&gt;/tune_coding_challenge/server/v1/user/users/</pre>

If your php service is on a port other than port 80, edit &lt;git root&gt;/app/src/api/api.js file and update the port in the url as http://localhost/tune_coding_challenge/server/v1/user/users/.


### React App

npm (Node Package Manager) is required for the React App. Please see the details here and install the npm first:
<pre>https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</pre>

Open command prompt inside &lt;git root&gt;/app folder where package.json is located. And run the following command:

<pre>npm install</pre>

The above command will install required node modules and packages. Once installation is done, run:

<pre>yarn start</pre>

The above command would start the react app on the machine accessible at port 3000 by default. For example on local machine, open the following url in the browser:

<pre>http://localhost:3000</pre>

And it should load the User Dashboard app.


# Design

Here is my approach.


## Frontend
I have used ReactJs for the frontend. Which runs on port 3000 of my local machine.

React Packages Used:
* axios - for over the network calls
* semantic-ui-react - for beautiful UI
* Avatar - for avatars with name initials
* react-chartjs-2 - for charts

The main entry point is App.js.
This module is UserDashboard module. Which is used in App.js. 
UserDashboard fetches data and calls CardComponent to build cards. Which in turn uses Charts component and the 3rd party Avatar package.
Semantic UI package is used for rendering Cards inside CardComponent.

To get this running on your machine, node_modules would be needed. Please run npm install inside solution-farman/app/ directory.


## Backend:
I created a custom Model-Controller framework for this. Runs on port 80 of my local machine.

index.php is the entry point. Which:
* Grabs the request
* Sorts out the requested route
* Invokes the relevant Controller->Action
* Responds to the request

Router.php helps with finding out the route. It plays on a pre-specified url structure. Returns the names of respective Controller and Action to be called upon.

UserController.php is the specific controller to handle user dashboard related requests. Gets the models, gets the data and returns.

Config.php is for app configuration. Can be moved to db later. Right now it just helps switch between models.

Model Design:
* base - ModelAbstract.php
* document - DocumentModel.php extends ModelAbstract.php
* rdbms - RDBMSModel.php extends ModelAbstract.php
* Model.php - Provides the model to be used according to current app configuration

The base functionality goes into ModelAbstract.php. As of now it just provides a prototype.
Document DB related functionality, which is our current case, is provided by DocumentModel.php
Relational DB related functionality, to be provided by RDBMSModel.php

## Next Steps
If I were to spend more time on this I would do the following as the next steps:

* Search Functionality
* Sorting and Filters
* Further optimize data retrieval part of the code
* Pagination
* Workable Menu
* Further improve the UI


## Remarks
It was an interesting exercise. I enjoyed it.

Thanks!
